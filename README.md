# CalculateFleetState
My assumptions:
1- While reading the input file, instance type will be
 controlled and if it is valid, a line will assign to
 an object and added to a list. If it is not valid,
 it will be written into a log file with its instance
 type.
2- There are 3 files; input file, output file and log
file. These files are given in config.properties file
for their location. You can change the directories
from project directory->resources->config.properties 
file.
